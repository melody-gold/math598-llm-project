      "with you, just in case, as you always did, and Winnie-the-Pooh went to a\n",
      "very muddy place that he knew of, and rolled and rolled until he was\n",
      "black all over; and then, when the balloon was blown up as big as big,\n",
      "and you and Pooh were both holding on to the string, you let go\n",
      "suddenly, and Pooh Bear floated gracefully up into the sky, and stayed\n",

      "\n",
      "Well, you laughed to yourself, \"Silly old Bear!\" but you didn't say it\n",
      "aloud because you were so fond of him, and you went home for your\n",
      "umbrella.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, there you are!\" called down Winnie-the-Pooh, as soon as you got\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Shall I put my umbrella up?\" you said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, but wait a moment. We must be practical. The important bee to\n",

      "\n",
      "But his arms were so stiff from holding on to the string of the balloon\n",

      "his Stoutness Exercises in front of the glass: _Tra-la-la, tra-la-la_,\n",
      "as he stretched up as high as he could go, and then _Tra-la-la,\n",
      "tra-la--oh, help!--la_, as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast\n",
      "he had said it over and over to himself until he had learnt it off by\n",
      "heart, and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like\n",
      "this:\n",
      "\n",

      "Well, he was humming this hum to himself, and walking along gaily,\n",
      "wondering what everybody else was doing, and what it felt like, being\n",
      "somebody else, when suddenly he came to a sandy bank, and in the bank\n",
      "was a large hole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Aha!\" said Pooh. (_Rum-tum-tiddle-um-tum._) \"If I know anything about\n",
      "anything, that hole means Rabbit,\" he said, \"and Rabbit means Company,\"\n",

      "\n",
      "So he bent down, put his head into the hole, and called out:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Is anybody at home?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a sudden scuffling noise from inside the hole, and then\n",

      "\n",
      "\"What I said was, 'Is anybody at home?'\" called out Pooh very loudly.\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"Isn't there anybody here at all?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Nobody.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Winnie-the-Pooh took his head out of the hole, and thought for a little,\n",
      "and he thought to himself, \"There must be somebody there, because\n",
      "somebody must have _said_ 'Nobody.'\" So he put his head back in the\n",
      "hole, and said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo, Rabbit, isn't that you?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Rabbit, in a different sort of voice this time.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But isn't that Rabbit's voice?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I don't _think_ so,\" said Rabbit. \"It isn't _meant_ to be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" said Pooh.\n",
      "\n",
      "He took his head out of the hole, and had another think, and then he put\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, then, come in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So Pooh pushed and pushed and pushed his way through the hole, and at\n",
      "last he got in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You were quite right,\" said Rabbit, looking at him all over. \"It _is_\n",
      "you. Glad to see you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Who did you think it was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, I wasn't sure. You know how it is in the Forest. One can't have\n",
      "_anybody_ coming into one's house. One has to be _careful_. What about a\n",
      "mouthful of something?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pooh always liked a little something at eleven o'clock in the morning,\n",

      "when Rabbit said, \"Honey or condensed milk with your bread?\" he was so\n",
      "excited that he said, \"Both,\" and then, so as not to seem greedy, he\n",
      "added, \"But don't bother about the bread, please.\" And for a long time\n",
      "after that he said nothing ... until at last, humming to himself in a\n",
      "rather sticky voice, he got up, shook Rabbit lovingly by the paw, and\n",
      "said that he must be going on.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Must you?\" said Rabbit politely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Pooh, \"I could stay a little longer if it--if you----\" and\n",
      "he tried very hard to look in the direction of the larder.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact,\" said Rabbit, \"I was going out myself directly.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, well, then, I'll be going on. Good-bye.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Well, good-bye, if you're sure you won't have any more.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Is_ there any more?\" asked Pooh quickly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rabbit took the covers off the dishes, and said, \"No, there wasn't.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I thought not,\" said Pooh, nodding to himself. \"Well, good-bye. I must\n",
      "be going on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he started to climb out of the hole. He pulled with his front paws,\n",
      "and pushed with his back paws, and in a little while his nose was out in\n",
      "the open again ... and then his ears ... and then his front paws ...\n",
      "and then his shoulders ... and then----\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, help!\" said Pooh. \"I'd better go back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, bother!\" said Pooh. \"I shall have to go on.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I can't do either!\" said Pooh. \"Oh, help _and_ bother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Now by this time Rabbit wanted to go for a walk too, and finding the\n",
      "front door full, he went out by the back door, and came round to Pooh,\n",
      "and looked at him.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Hallo, are you stuck?\" he asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"N-no,\" said Pooh carelessly. \"Just resting and thinking and humming to\n",
      "myself.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Here, give us a paw.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pooh Bear stretched out a paw, and Rabbit pulled and pulled and\n",
      "pulled....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Ow!_\" cried Pooh. \"You're hurting!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The fact is,\" said Rabbit, \"you're stuck.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It all comes,\" said Pooh crossly, \"of not having front doors big\n",
      "enough.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It all comes,\" said Rabbit sternly, \"of eating too much. I thought at\n",
      "the time,\" said Rabbit, \"only I didn't like to say anything,\" said\n",
      "Rabbit, \"that one of us was eating too much,\" said Rabbit, \"and I knew\n",
      "if wasn't _me_,\" he said. \"Well, well, I shall go and fetch Christopher\n",
      "Robin.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Christopher Robin lived at the other end of the Forest, and when he came\n",
      "back with Rabbit, and saw the front half of Pooh, he said, \"Silly old\n",
      "Bear,\" in such a loving voice that everybody felt quite hopeful again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I was just beginning to think,\" said Bear, sniffing slightly, \"that\n",
      "Rabbit might never be able to use his front door again. And I should\n",
      "_hate_ that,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So should I,\" said Rabbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Use his front door again?\" said Christopher Robin. \"Of course he'll use\n",
      "his front door again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good,\" said Rabbit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If we can't pull you out, Pooh, we might push you back.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Rabbit scratched his whiskers thoughtfully, and pointed out that, when\n",
      "once Pooh was pushed back, he was back, and of course nobody was more\n",
      "glad to see Pooh than _he_ was, still there it was, some lived in trees\n",
      "and some lived underground, and----\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You mean I'd _never_ get out?\" said Pooh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I mean,\" said Rabbit, \"that having got _so_ far, it seems a pity to\n",
      "waste it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Christopher Robin nodded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then there's only one thing to be done,\" he said. \"We shall have to\n",
      "wait for you to get thin again.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"How long does getting thin take?\" asked Pooh anxiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About a week, I should think.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"But I can't stay here for a _week_!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"You can _stay_ here all right, silly old Bear. It's getting you out\n",
      "which is so difficult.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll read to you,\" said Rabbit cheerfully. \"And I hope it won't snow,\"\n",
      "he added. \"And I say, old fellow, you're taking up a good deal of room\n",
      "in my house--_do_ you mind if I use your back legs as a towel-horse?\n",
      "Because, I mean, there they are--doing nothing--and it would be very\n",
      "convenient just to hang the towels on them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A week!\" said Pooh gloomily. \"_What about meals?_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm afraid no meals,\" said Christopher Robin, \"because of getting thin\n",
      "quicker. But we _will_ read to you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Bear began to sigh, and then found he couldn't because he was so tightly\n",
      "stuck; and a tear rolled down his eye, as he said:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then would you read a Sustaining Book, such as would help and comfort a\n",
      "Wedged Bear in Great Tightness?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So for a week Christopher Robin read that sort of book at the North end\n",
      "of Pooh, and Rabbit hung his washing on the South end ... and in\n",
      "between Bear felt himself getting slenderer and slenderer. And at the\n",
      "end of the week Christopher Robin said, \"_Now!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took hold of Pooh's front paws and Rabbit took hold of Christopher\n",
      "Robin, and all Rabbit's friends and relations took hold of Rabbit, and\n",
      "they all pulled together....\n",
      "\n",
      "And for a long time Pooh only said \"_Ow!_\" ...\n",
      "\n",
      "And \"_Oh!_\" ...\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, all of a sudden, he said \"_Pop!_\" just as if a cork were\n",

      "And Christopher Robin and Rabbit and all Rabbit's friends and relations\n",
      "went head-over-heels backwards ... and on the top of them came\n",

      "\n",
      "So, with a nod of thanks to his friends, he went on with his walk\n",

      "you see there?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Tracks,\" said Piglet. \"Paw-marks.\" He gave a little squeak of\n",
      "excitement. \"Oh, Pooh! Do you think it's a--a--a Woozle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It may be,\" said Pooh. \"Sometimes it is, and sometimes it isn't. You\n",
      "never can tell with paw-marks.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "With these few words he went on tracking, and Piglet, after watching him\n",
      "for a minute or two, ran after him. Winnie-the-Pooh had come to a sudden\n",
      "stop, and was bending over the tracks in a puzzled sort of way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What's the matter?\" asked Piglet.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a very funny thing,\" said Bear, \"but there seem to be\n",
      "_two_ animals now. This--whatever-it-was--has been joined by\n",
      "another--whatever-it-is--and the two of them are now proceeding\n",
      "in company. Would you mind coming with me, Piglet, in case they\n",
      "turn out to be Hostile Animals?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Piglet scratched his ear in a nice sort of way, and said that he had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"You mean, in case it really is two Woozles,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, and\n",
      "Piglet said that anyhow he had nothing to do until Friday. So off they\n",
      "went together.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a small spinney of larch trees just here, and it seemed as if\n",
      "the two Woozles, if that is what they were, had been going round this\n",
      "spinney; so round this spinney went Pooh and Piglet after them; Piglet\n",
      "passing the time by telling Pooh what his Grandfather Trespassers W had\n",
      "done to Remove Stiffness after Tracking, and how his Grandfather\n",
      "Trespassers W had suffered in his later years from Shortness of Breath,\n",
      "and other matters of interest, and Pooh wondering what a Grandfather was\n",
      "like, and if perhaps this was Two Grandfathers they were after now, and,\n",
      "if so, whether he would be allowed to take one home and keep it, and\n",
      "what Christopher Robin would say. And still the tracks went on in front\n",
      "of them....\n",
      "\n",
      "Suddenly Winnie-the-Pooh stopped, and pointed excitedly in front of him.\n",
      "\"_Look!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_What?_\" said Piglet, with a jump. And then, to show that he hadn't\n",
      "been frightened, he jumped up and down once or twice more in an\n",
      "exercising sort of way.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The tracks!\" said Pooh. \"_A third animal has joined the other two!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Pooh!\" cried Piglet. \"Do you think it is another Woozle?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Pooh, \"because it makes different marks. It is either Two\n",
      "Woozles and one, as it might be, Wizzle, or Two, as it might be, Wizzles\n",
      "and one, if so it is, Woozle. Let us continue to follow them.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went on, feeling just a little anxious now, in case the three\n",
      "animals in front of them were of Hostile Intent. And Piglet wished very\n",
      "much that his Grandfather T. W. were there, instead of elsewhere, and\n",
      "Pooh thought how nice it would be if they met Christopher Robin suddenly\n",
      "but quite accidentally, and only because he liked Christopher Robin so\n",
      "much. And then, all of a sudden, Winnie-the-Pooh stopped again, and\n",
      "licked the tip of his nose in a cooling manner, for he was feeling more\n",
      "hot and anxious than ever in his life before. _There were four animals\n",
      "in front of them!_\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Do you see, Piglet? Look at their tracks! Three, as it were, Woozles,\n",
      "and one, as it was, Wizzle. _Another Woozle has joined them!_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "And so it seemed to be. There were the tracks; crossing over each other\n",
      "here, getting muddled up with each other there; but, quite plainly every\n",
      "now and then, the tracks of four sets of paws.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I _think_,\" said Piglet, when he had licked the tip of his nose too,\n",
      "and found that it brought very little comfort, \"I _think_ that I have\n",
      "just remembered something. I have just remembered something that I\n",
      "forgot to do yesterday and shan't be able to do to-morrow. So I suppose\n",
      "I really ought to go back and do it now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We'll do it this afternoon, and I'll come with you,\" said Pooh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It isn't the sort of thing you can do in the afternoon,\" said Piglet\n",
      "quickly. \"It's a very particular morning thing, that has to be done in\n",
      "the morning, and, if possible, between the hours of----What would you\n",
      "say the time was?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"About twelve,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, looking at the sun.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Between, as I was saying, the hours of twelve and twelve five. So,\n",
      "really, dear old Pooh, if you'll excuse me----_What's that?_\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pooh looked up at the sky, and then, as he heard the whistle again, he\n",
      "looked up into the branches of a big oak-tree, and then he saw a friend\n",
      "of his.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's Christopher Robin,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Ah, then you'll be all right,\" said Piglet. \"You'll be quite safe with\n",
      "_him_. Good-bye,\" and he trotted off home as quickly as he could, very\n",
      "glad to be Out of All Danger again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Christopher Robin came slowly down his tree.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Silly old Bear,\" he said, \"what _were_ you doing? First you went round\n",
      "the spinney twice by yourself, and then Piglet ran after you and you\n",
      "went round again together, and then you were just going round a fourth\n",
      "time----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Wait a moment,\" said Winnie-the-Pooh, holding up his paw.\n",
      "\n",
      "He sat down and thought, in the most thoughtful way he could think. Then\n",
      "he fitted his paw into one of the Tracks ... and then he scratched his\n",

      "\"A lick of honey,\" murmured Bear to himself, \"or--or not, as the case\n",

      "Owl was saying.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Owl went on and on, using longer and longer words, until at last he\n",

      "them now.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So they went outside. And Pooh looked at the knocker and the notice\n",
      "below it, and he looked at the bell-rope and the notice below it, and\n",
      "the more he looked at the bell-rope, the more he felt that he had seen\n",
      "something like it, somewhere else, sometime before.\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"It reminds me of something,\" he said, \"but I can't think what. Where\n",
      "did you get it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I just came across it in the Forest. It was hanging over a bush, and I\n",
      "thought at first somebody lived there, so I rang it, and nothing\n",
      "happened, and then I rang it again very loudly, and it came off in my\n",
      "hand, and as nobody seemed to want it, I took it home, and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Owl,\" said Pooh solemnly, \"you made a mistake. Somebody did want it.\"\n",

      "but when they came to the stream and had helped each other across the\n",

      "Very Deep Pit?_\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Piglet, \"I should do it like this. I should make a Trap,\n",

      "you would go in after it, and----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"And I would go in after it,\" said Pooh excitedly, \"only very carefully\n",
      "so as not to hurt myself, and I would get to the Jar of Honey, and I\n",
      "should lick round the edges first of all, pretending that there wasn't\n",
      "any more, you know, and then I should walk away and think about it a\n",
      "little, and then I should come back and start licking in the middle of\n",
      "the jar, and then----\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, well never mind about that. There you would be, and there I should\n",
      "catch you. Now the first thing to think of is, What do Heffalumps like?\n",
      "I should think acorns, shouldn't you? We'll get a lot of----I say, wake\n",
      "up, Pooh!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Pooh, who had gone into a happy dream, woke up with a start, and said\n",
      "that Honey was a much more trappy thing than Haycorns. Piglet didn't\n",

      "remembered that, if they put acorns in the Trap, _he_ would have to find\n",
      "the acorns, but if they put honey, then Pooh would have to give up some\n",
      "of his own honey, so he said, \"All right, honey then,\" just as Pooh\n",
      "remembered it too, and was going to say, \"All right, haycorns.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Honey,\" said Piglet to himself in a thoughtful way, as if it were now\n",
      "settled. \"_I'll_ dig the pit, while _you_ go and get the honey.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Very well,\" said Pooh, and he stumped off.\n",
      "\n",
      "As soon as he got home, he went to the larder; and he stood on a chair,\n",
      "and took down a very large jar of honey from the top shelf. It had HUNNY\n",
      "written on it, but, just to make sure, he took off the paper cover and\n",
      "looked at it, and it _looked_ just like honey. \"But you never can tell,\"\n",
      "said Pooh. \"I remember my uncle saying once that he had seen cheese just\n",
      "this colour.\" So he put his tongue in, and took a large lick. \"Yes,\" he\n",
      "said, \"it is. No doubt about that. And honey, I should say, right down\n",
      "to the bottom of the jar. Unless, of course,\" he said, \"somebody put\n",
      "cheese in at the bottom just for a joke. Perhaps I had better go a\n",
      "_little_ further ... just in case ... in case Heffalumps _don't_\n",
      "like cheese ... same as me.... Ah!\" And he gave a deep sigh. \"I\n",

      "Pooh said, \"Yes, but it isn't quite a full jar,\" and he threw it down to\n",

      "\"Well, good night, Pooh,\" said Piglet, when they had got to Pooh's\n",

      "\n",
      "Some hours later, just as the night was beginning to steal away, Pooh\n",
      "woke up suddenly with a sinking feeling. He had had that sinking feeling\n",
      "before, and he knew what it meant. _He was hungry._ So he went to the\n",
      "larder, and he stood on a chair and reached up to the top shelf, and\n",
      "found--nothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's funny,\" he thought. \"I know I had a jar of honey there. A full\n",
      "jar, full of honey right up to the top, and it had HUNNY written on it,\n",
      "so that I should know it was honey. That's very funny.\" And then he\n",
      "began to wander up and down, wondering where it was and murmuring a\n",
      "murmur to himself. Like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "    It's very, very funny,\n",
      "    'Cos I _know_ I had some honey;\n",
      "    'Cos it had a label on,\n",
      "            Saying HUNNY.\n",
      "    A goloptious full-up pot too,\n",
      "    And I don't know where it's got to,\n",
      "    No, I don't know where it's gone--\n",
      "            Well, it's funny.\n",
      "\n",
      "He had murmured this to himself three times in a singing sort of way,\n",
      "when suddenly he remembered. He had put it into the Cunning Trap to\n",
      "catch the Heffalump.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bother!\" said Pooh. \"It all comes of trying to be kind to Heffalumps.\"\n",
      "And he got back into bed.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he couldn't sleep. The more he tried to sleep, the more he couldn't.\n",
      "He tried Counting Sheep, which is sometimes a good way of getting to\n",
      "sleep, and, as that was no good, he tried counting Heffalumps. And that\n",
      "was worse. Because every Heffalump that he counted was making straight\n",
      "for a pot of Pooh's honey, _and eating it all_. For some minutes he lay\n",
      "there miserably, but when the five hundred and eighty-seventh Heffalump\n",
      "was licking its jaws, and saying to itself, \"Very good honey this, I\n",
      "don't know when I've tasted better,\" Pooh could bear it no longer. He\n",
      "jumped out of bed, he ran out of the house, and he ran straight to the\n",
      "Six Pine Trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sun was still in bed, but there was a lightness in the sky over the\n",
      "Hundred Acre Wood which seemed to show that it was waking up and would\n",
      "soon be kicking off the clothes. In the half-light the Pine Trees looked\n",
      "cold and lonely, and the Very Deep Pit seemed deeper than it was, and\n",
      "Pooh's jar of honey at the bottom was something mysterious, a shape and\n",
      "no more. But as he got nearer to it his nose told him that it was indeed\n",
      "honey, and his tongue came out and began to polish up his mouth, ready\n",
      "for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he got his nose inside the jar. \"A Heffalump has\n",
      "been eating it!\" And then he thought a little and said, \"Oh, no, _I_\n",
      "did. I forgot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, he had eaten most of it. But there was a little left at the very\n",
      "bottom of the jar, and he pushed his head right in, and began to\n",
      "lick....\n",
      "\n",
      "By and by Piglet woke up. As soon as he woke he said to himself, \"Oh!\"\n",
      "Then he said bravely, \"Yes,\" and then, still more bravely, \"Quite so.\"\n",
      "But he didn't feel very brave, for the word which was really jiggeting\n",
      "about in his brain was \"Heffalumps.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "What was a Heffalump like?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it Fierce?\n",
      "\n",
      "_Did_ it come when you whistled? And _how_ did it come?\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it Fond of Pigs at all?\n",
      "\n",
      "If it was Fond of Pigs, did it make any difference _what sort of Pig_?\n",
      "\n",
      "Supposing it was Fierce with Pigs, would it make any difference _if the\n",
      "Pig had a grandfather called TRESPASSERS WILLIAM_?\n",
      "\n",
      "He didn't know the answer to any of these questions ... and he was\n",
      "going to see his first Heffalump in about an hour from now!\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course Pooh would be with him, and it was much more Friendly with\n",
      "two. But suppose Heffalumps were Very Fierce with Pigs _and_ Bears?\n",
      "Wouldn't it be better to pretend that he had a headache, and couldn't go\n",
      "up to the Six Pine Trees this morning? But then suppose that it was a\n",
      "very fine day, and there was no Heffalump in the trap, here he would be,\n",
      "in bed all the morning, simply wasting his time for nothing. What should\n",
      "he do?\n",
      "\n",
      "And then he had a Clever Idea. He would go up very quietly to the Six\n",
      "Pine Trees now, peep very cautiously into the Trap, and see if there\n",
      "_was_ a Heffalump there. And if there was, he would go back to bed, and\n",
      "if there wasn't, he wouldn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "So off he went. At first he thought that there wouldn't be a Heffalump\n",
      "in the Trap, and then he thought that there would, and as he got nearer\n",
      "he was _sure_ that there would, because he could hear it heffalumping\n",
      "about it like anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear!\" said Piglet to himself. And he wanted to\n",
      "run away. But somehow, having got so near, he felt that he must just see\n",
      "what a Heffalump was like. So he crept to the side of the Trap and\n",
      "looked in....\n",
      "\n",
      "And all the time Winnie-the-Pooh had been trying to get the honey-jar\n",
      "off his head. The more he shook it, the more tightly it stuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Bother!_\" he said, inside the jar, and \"_Oh, help!_\" and, mostly,\n",
      "\"_Ow!_\" And he tried bumping it against things, but as he couldn't see\n",
      "what he was bumping it against, it didn't help him; and he tried to\n",
      "climb out of the Trap, but as he could see nothing but jar, and not much\n",
      "of that, he couldn't find his way. So at last he lifted up his head, jar\n",
      "and all, and made a loud, roaring noise of Sadness and Despair ... and\n",
      "it was at that moment that Piglet looked down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Help, help!\" cried Piglet, \"a Heffalump, a Horrible Heffalump!\" and he\n",
      "scampered off as hard as he could, still crying out, \"Help, help, a\n",
      "Herrible Hoffalump! Hoff, Hoff, a Hellible Horralump! Holl, Holl, a\n",

      "got to Christopher Robin's house.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Whatever's the matter, Piglet?\" said Christopher Robin, who was just\n",
      "getting up.\n",

      "It was Pooh bumping his head against a tree-root he had found.\n",

      "\"Oh!\" said Pooh. \"So it is,\" he said. \"Well, let's go in.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So in they went. The first thing Pooh did was to go to the cupboard to\n",
      "see if he had quite a small jar of honey left; and he had, so he took it\n",
      "down.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'm giving this to Eeyore,\" he explained, \"as a present. What are _you_\n",
      "going to give?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Couldn't I give it too?\" said Piglet. \"From both of us?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"All right, then, I'll give him a balloon. I've got one left from my\n",
      "party. I'll go and get it now, shall I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That, Piglet, is a _very_ good idea. It is just what Eeyore wants to\n",
      "cheer him up. Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So off Piglet trotted; and in the other direction went Pooh, with his\n",
      "jar of honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was a warm day, and he had a long way to go. He hadn't gone more than\n",
      "half-way when a sort of funny feeling began to creep all over him. It\n",
      "began at the tip of his nose and trickled all through him and out at the\n",
      "soles of his feet. It was just as if somebody inside him were saying,\n",
      "\"Now then, Pooh, time for a little something.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Dear, dear,\" said Pooh, \"I didn't know it was as late as that.\" So he\n",
      "sat down and took the top off his jar of honey. \"Lucky I brought this\n",
      "with me,\" he thought. \"Many a bear going out on a warm day like this\n",
      "would never have thought of bringing a little something with him.\" And\n",
      "he began to eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now let me see,\" he thought, as he took his last lick of the inside of\n",
      "the jar, \"where was I going? Ah, yes, Eeyore.\" He got up slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then, suddenly, he remembered. He had eaten Eeyore's birthday\n",
      "present!\n",
      "\n",
      "\"_Bother!_\" said Pooh. \"What _shall_ I do? I _must_ give him\n",
      "_something_.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "For a little while he couldn't think of anything. Then he thought:\n",
      "\"Well, it's a very nice pot, even if there's no honey in it, and if I\n",
      "washed it clean, and got somebody to write '_A Happy Birthday_' on it,\n",
      "Eeyore could keep things in it, which might be Useful.\" So, as he was\n",
      "just passing the Hundred Acre Wood, he went inside to call on Owl, who\n",
      "lived there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, Owl,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Good morning, Pooh,\" said Owl.\n",

      "\"_That_ was what I wanted to ask you,\" said Pooh. \"Because my spelling\n",

      "wrong places. Would _you_ write 'A Happy Birthday' on it for me?\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\"No,\" said Pooh. \"That would _not_ be a good plan. Now I'll just wash it\n",

      "Christopher Robin or Pooh or Eeyore again. And then he thought, \"Well,\n",

      "\n",
      "He was still in the Forest!\n",

      "opening his mouth to begin something, and then deciding that it wasn't\n",
      "any good saying _that_, when he heard a shout from the other side of the\n",
      "river, and there was Pooh.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Many happy returns of the day,\" called out Pooh, forgetting that he had\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Yes, dear, yes,\" said Kanga soothingly. \"And imitating Piglet's voice\n",
      "too! So clever of him,\" she went on, as she took a large bar of yellow\n",
      "soap out of the cupboard. \"What _will_ he be doing next?\"\n",

      "speak to you about it again.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't open the mouth, dear, or the soap goes in,\" said Kanga. \"There!\n",
      "What did I tell you?\"\n",

      "\"You--you--you did it on purpose,\" spluttered Piglet, as soon as he\n",
      "could speak again ... and then accidentally had another mouthful of\n",
      "lathery flannel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"That's right, dear, don't say anything,\" said Kanga, and in another\n",
      "minute Piglet was out of the bath, and being rubbed dry with a towel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now,\" said Kanga, \"there's your medicine, and then bed.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "\"To make you grow big and strong, dear. You don't want to grow up small\n",

      "\n",
      "At that moment there was a knock at the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Come in,\" said Kanga, and in came Christopher Robin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Christopher Robin, Christopher Robin!\" cried Piglet. \"Tell Kanga who I\n",
      "am! She keeps saying I'm Roo. I'm _not_ Roo, am I?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Christopher Robin looked at him very carefully, and shook his head.\n",

      "\n",
      "Piglet began to say that this was because he had just had a bath, and\n",
      "then he thought that perhaps he wouldn't say that, and as he opened his\n",
      "mouth to say something else, Kanga slipped the medicine spoon in, and\n",
      "then patted him on the back and told him that it was really quite a nice\n",
      "taste when you got used to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I knew it wasn't Piglet,\" said Kanga. \"I wonder who it can be.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Perhaps it's some relation of Pooh's,\" said Christopher Robin. \"What\n",
      "about a nephew or an uncle or something?\"\n",

      "saying, \"I should think poor old Rabbit is about flooded out by this\n",
      "time.\" It would have been jolly to talk like this, and really, it wasn't\n",
      "much good having anything exciting like floods, if you couldn't share\n",
      "them with somebody.\n",
      "\n",
      "For it was rather exciting. The little dry ditches in which Piglet had\n",
      "nosed about so often had become streams, the little streams across which\n",
      "he had splashed were rivers, and the river, between whose steep banks\n",
      "they had played so happily, had sprawled out of its own bed and was\n",
      "taking up so much room everywhere, that Piglet was beginning to wonder\n",
      "whether it would be coming into _his_ bed soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a little Anxious,\" he said to himself, \"to be a Very Small Animal\n",

      "\n",
      "It went on raining, and every day the water got a little higher, until\n",

      "anything.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's Pooh,\" he thought to himself. \"Pooh hasn't much Brain, but he\n",
      "never comes to any harm. He does silly things and they turn out right.\n",
      "There's Owl. Owl hasn't exactly got Brain, but he Knows Things. He would\n",
      "know the Right Thing to Do when Surrounded by Water. There's Rabbit. He\n",
      "hasn't Learnt in Books, but he can always Think of a Clever Plan.\n",
      "There's Kanga. She isn't Clever, Kanga isn't, but she would be so\n",
      "anxious about Roo that she would do a Good Thing to Do without thinking\n",
      "about It. And then there's Eeyore. And Eeyore is so miserable anyhow\n",
      "that he wouldn't mind about this. But I wonder what Christopher Robin\n",
      "would do?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly he remembered a story which Christopher Robin had told him\n",
      "about a man on a desert island who had written something in a bottle and\n",
      "thrown it in the sea; and Piglet thought that if he wrote something in a\n",
      "bottle and threw it in the water, perhaps somebody would come and rescue\n",
      "_him_!\n",
      "\n",
      "He left the window and began to search his house, all of it that wasn't\n",
      "under water, and at last he found a pencil and a small piece of dry\n",
      "paper, and a bottle with a cork to it. And he wrote on one side of the\n",
      "paper:\n",
      "\n",
      "                                 HELP!\n",
      "                              PIGLET (ME)\n",
      "\n",
      "and on the other side:\n",
      "\n",
      "                       IT'S ME PIGLET, HELP HELP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he put the paper in the bottle, and he corked the bottle up as\n",
      "tightly as he could, and he leant out of his window as far as he could\n",
      "lean without falling in, and he threw the bottle as far as he could\n",
      "throw--_splash!_--and in a little while it bobbed up again on the water;\n",
      "and he watched it floating slowly away in the distance, until his eyes\n",
      "ached with looking, and sometimes he thought it was the bottle, and\n",
      "sometimes he thought it was just a ripple on the water which he was\n",
      "following, and then suddenly he knew that he would never see it again\n",
      "and that he had done all that he could do to save himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"So now,\" he thought, \"somebody else will have to do something, and I\n",
      "hope they will do it soon, because if they don't I shall have to swim,\n",
      "which I can't, so I hope they do it soon.\" And then he gave a very long\n",
      "sigh and said, \"I wish Pooh were here. It's so much more friendly with\n",
      "two.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "When the rain began Pooh was asleep. It rained, and it rained, and it\n",
      "rained, and he slept and he slept and he slept. He had had a tiring day.\n",
      "You remember how he discovered the North Pole; well, he was so proud of\n",
      "this that he asked Christopher Robin if there were any other Poles such\n",
      "as a Bear of Little Brain might discover.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"There's a South Pole,\" said Christopher Robin, \"and I expect there's an\n",

      "\n",
      "Pooh was very excited when he heard this, and suggested that they should\n",
      "have an Expotition to discover the East Pole, but Christopher Robin had\n",
      "thought of something else to do with Kanga; so Pooh went out to discover\n",
      "the East Pole by himself. Whether he discovered it or not, I forget; but\n",
      "he was so tired when he got home that, in the very middle of his supper,\n",
      "after he had been eating for little more than half-an-hour, he fell fast\n",
      "asleep in his chair, and slept and slept and slept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then suddenly he was dreaming. He was at the East Pole, and it was a\n",
      "very cold pole with the coldest sort of snow and ice all over it. He had\n",
      "found a bee-hive to sleep in, but there wasn't room for his legs, so he\n",
      "had left them outside. And Wild Woozles, such as inhabit the East Pole,\n",
      "came and nibbled all the fur off his legs to make nests for their Young.\n",
      "And the more they nibbled, the colder his legs got, until suddenly he\n",
      "woke up with an _Ow!_--and there he was, sitting in his chair with his\n",
      "feet in the water, and water all round him!\n",
      "\n",
      "He splashed to his door and looked out....\n",
      "\n",
      "\"This is Serious,\" said Pooh. \"I must have an Escape.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took his largest pot of honey and escaped with it to a broad\n",
      "branch of his tree, well above the water, and then he climbed down again\n",
      "and escaped with another pot ... and when the whole Escape was\n",
      "finished, there was Pooh sitting on his branch, dangling his legs, and\n",
      "there, beside him, were ten pots of honey....\n",
      "\n",
      "Two days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\n",
      "legs, and there, beside him, were four pots of honey....\n",

      "Three days later, there was Pooh, sitting on his branch, dangling his\n",
      "legs, and there beside him, was one pot of honey.\n",
      "\n",
      "Four days later, there was Pooh ...\n",
      "\n",
      "And it was on the morning of the fourth day that Piglet's bottle came\n",
      "floating past him, and with one loud cry of \"Honey!\" Pooh plunged into\n",
      "the water, seized the bottle, and struggled back to his tree again.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bother!\" said Pooh, as he opened it. \"All that wet for nothing. What's\n",
      "that bit of paper doing?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "He took it out and looked at it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a Missage,\" he said to himself, \"that's what it is. And that\n",
      "letter is a 'P,' and so is that, and so is that, and 'P' means 'Pooh,'\n",
      "so it's a very important Missage to me, and I can't read it. I must find\n",
      "Christopher Robin or Owl or Piglet, one of those Clever Readers who can\n",
      "read things, and they will tell me what this missage means. Only I can't\n",
      "swim. Bother!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he had an idea, and I think that for a Bear of Very Little Brain,\n",
      "it was a good idea. He said to himself:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"If a bottle can float, then a jar can float, and if a jar floats, I can\n",
      "sit on the top of it, if it's a very big jar.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "So he took his biggest jar, and corked it up. \"All boats have to have a\n",

      "these words he dropped his boat into the water and jumped in after it.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a little while Pooh and _The Floating Bear_ were uncertain as to\n",
      "which of them was meant to be on the top, but after trying one or two\n",

      "rained, and it rained, but the water couldn't come up to _his_ house. It\n",
      "was rather jolly to look down into the valleys and see the water all\n",
      "round him, but it rained so hard that he stayed indoors most of the\n",
      "time, and thought about things. Every morning he went out with his\n",
      "umbrella and put a stick in the place where the water came up to, and\n",
      "every next morning he went out and couldn't see his stick any more, so\n",
      "he put another stick in the place where the water came up to, and then\n",

      "could you rescue him on your back?\"\n",

      "\"Now then, Pooh,\" said Christopher Robin, \"where's your boat?\"\n",
      "\n",
